**Build and deploy distributed deep learning applications on Apache Spark**

## What is this book about?
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where data sets with several layers of complexity can be processed. This book teaches you the different techniques using which deep learning solutions can be implemented at scale, on Apache Spark. This will help you gain experience of implementing your deep learning models in many real-world use cases.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basics of deep learning
* Set up Apache Spark for deep learning
* Understand the principles of distribution modeling and different types of neural networks
* Obtain an understanding of deep learning algorithms
* Discover textual analysis and deep learning with Spark

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Musician:
def __init__(self, name):
self.name = name
def __str__(self):
   return f'the musician {self.name}'
def play(self):
  return 'plays music'
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a Scala developer, data scientist, or data analyst who wants to learn how to use Spark for implementing efficient deep learning models, Hands-On Deep Learning with Apache Spark is for you. Knowledge of the core machine learning concepts and some exposure to Spark will be helpful.
